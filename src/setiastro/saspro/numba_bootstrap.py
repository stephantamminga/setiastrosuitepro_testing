"""
Steer Numba away from the TBB threading layer BEFORE Numba is ever imported.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
On CPython 3.14 (Windows) the TBB threading layer aborts the process with a
native access violation during the first parallel JIT compile — the crash the
handoff traced to astroalign.warmup_jit. That abort is a *structured exception*,
not a Python exception, so it CANNOT be caught with try/except: the guard inside
warmup_jit is inert against it. The only reliable defense is to make sure Numba
never selects TBB on the fragile combo.

Numba resolves its threading layer once, at import time, and (with
THREADING_LAYER left at its 'default') picks the first AVAILABLE layer from
THREADING_LAYER_PRIORITY. So instead of hard-forcing 'workqueue', we demote TBB
to last in that priority list:

    omp  ->  workqueue  ->  tbb

omp is threadsafe and keeps real parallelism; workqueue is the always-available
pure-C fallback. Because workqueue is always available, tbb is never reached —
it can't be selected, so it can't crash. If omp is present and healthy on this
machine the user gets it (and stays off the not-threadsafe workqueue path that
the blink loader has to serialize around); otherwise they get workqueue and the
app still boots.

This must be imported as the very first thing in every process entry point
(gui_entry, the CLI, __main__) — before any module that does `import numba` or
`from numba import ...`. Importing it runs configure() for side effect.

VERIFYING IT WORKED
-------------------
numba_warmup._do_warmup() logs `Numba threading layer resolved: <layer>` after
a parallel kernel runs. Read that line in saspro.log:
  - 'omp'       -> best case: threadsafe + parallel, blink (#3) unlikely to bite
  - 'workqueue' -> booted safely, but NOT threadsafe; confirm NUMBA_PARALLEL_LOCK
                   covers the blink loader before calling #3 closed
  - 'tbb'       -> the demotion did NOT take effect; investigate before shipping
